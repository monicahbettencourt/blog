[{"content":"Every time I\u0026rsquo;d open my email app, I would feel a pinch of despair. With over 3000 messages, I felt discouraged about how I could solve this. Processing a few messages at a time wasn\u0026rsquo;t working.\nInspired by Mischa van den Burg\u0026rsquo;s video The Importance of Digital Housekeeping, at the end of July I decided to challenge myself and clean my email inbox in one sitting.\nProblems I had two major problems caused by a poorly managed email system:\nI was missing important incoming messages; The sheer volume of inbox messages was visually distracting. Planning Stage I had to plan a long session of uninterrupted work to be able to do this in one sitting. This was important to me: I was about to begin another stage of my independent studies and I needed the least amount of friction possible, to avoid being distracted or hindered in my efforts.\nIt took me about five hours of focused work, without distractions or external interruptions. I had a few breaks to recharge both focus and motivation to complete this task.\nThe system Here\u0026rsquo;s how I did it:\nUnsubscribing from everything that didn\u0026rsquo;t serve my current goals This is was crucial step, as it limited the inflow of unwanted messages. I used the search function for this, unsubscribing and immediately deleting all the messages from that sender.\nIt was a slow, but very important process.\nCreating folders to store processed messages I created folders as I sorted the messages. Here are some examples:\nPersonal; Learning: Family; Finances; Bank Orders; Pending orders; Reading; Receipts; Shopping; Utilities; Work. Processing messages Using the search function, I deleted every message that I evaluated as not important. The important ones were moved into their respective folders.\nNowadays, when I receive a message, I do my best to immediately process it : Do I need to save it? If so, I move it to its folder, creating one if necessary. If it\u0026rsquo;s not important, I delete it.\nI clear the trash folder right away. By doing this, I make sure that I\u0026rsquo;m mindful about the evaluation process.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t use the arquive option. Every message has its proper place: it either goes into a folder or it is deleted.\nResult As the message count went down, a feeling of hope and relief kept growing. But it took time and patience. And then, it was zero.\nThe challenge had been overcome. After all, it is possible to clear a poorly managed email inbox.\nConclusion When the inbox is empty, I get constant motivation to use this systematic approach and keep it empty. If there are 15 or 20 messages, I can easily sort them and delete the ones that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to save.\nOne month after the initial cleanup, I restructured the folders to adapt to my needs.\nAs this is an evolving system, I\u0026rsquo;ll change it whenever it\u0026rsquo;s necessary.\nThis was a meaningful experience, since I had to evaluate my goals and change how I use this tool. Now it works for me, not the other way around.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/from-3000-to-zero/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEvery time I\u0026rsquo;d open my email app, I would feel a pinch of despair.

So, when I decided to start this learning journey it didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense for me to begin at the software layer: I sought to learn about how computers are built, their different components and their functions.\nAfter a while, I felt the need to see and hold these parts in my hands, because learning the theory is important, but putting that knowledge into practice consolidates what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned.\nTwo months ago, on an afternoon adventure, I disassembled and reassembled an older desktop computer.\nFirst Impressions As I opened the lid and looked inside, the number of cables was impressive. Then something interesting came to mind. The CPU, the motherboard, and all the cables connecting it to the other components reminded me of the central and peripheral nervous systems\u0026rsquo; anatomy: the spinal cord, the brain, and the peripheral nerves.\nDisassembling the PC was the easier part. I took my time with it, examined each part carefully, and also took pictures. Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have thermal paste at the time, I left the CPU on the motherboard.\nI was feeling confident and enthusiastic until I began reassembling everything.\nTroubleshooting Reassembling every component was harder than I expected. Attaching all the cables to the right connectors took me some time and patience.\nWhen I was almost done screwing the HDD to its rack, I dropped a screw into a narrow crevice of the case. As I assessed the problem at hand, shaking the case to get it out wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option since it was stuck in place and I risked damaging the components. So, I grabbed a stylus from the screwdriver set and adhesive tape, and after a few unsuccessful attempts, I managed to fish it out. What a relief!\nAs I pressed the power button, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure the computer would start. But it did, and I was both relieved and overjoyed to accomplish this task.\nConclusion This was a surprisingly successful experience. The only negative outcome was scratching my desk with the PC\u0026rsquo;s case, which I\u0026rsquo;ve repaired with a matching marker.\nBesides putting theoretical knowledge into practice, here are some of the things I leaned from this experience:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to prepare your working area and assemble the right tools for the task; Confidence increases with experimentation: not being afraid to fail allows you to learn faster; Hands-on learning is both fun and effective; It\u0026rsquo;s always good to have a backup plan if things don\u0026rsquo;t work out as expected. Since this hardware adventure, I\u0026rsquo;ve upgraded my laptop\u0026rsquo;s 250GB M2 SDD to a 1TB M2 SDD and converted the former into an external drive with a nice metal case. Following that, I reinstalled Windows 11 and Ubuntu in dual boot, as that\u0026rsquo;s my usual setup.\nOvercoming this challenge gave me confidence to attempt fixing or replacing my computer\u0026rsquo;s components if needed, and increased my overall interest and curiosity around information technology.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/first-hardware-experiment/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI always had an interest in finding out how things worked to really understand them.
