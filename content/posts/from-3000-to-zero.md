title: 'From 3000 to Zero: My Email Inbox Cleanup'
tags: ["productivity"]
---
Every time I'd open my email app, I would feel a pinch of despair. With over 3000 messages, I felt discouraged about how I could solve this. Processing a few messages at a time wasn't working.

Inspired by Mischa van den Burg's video [The Importance of Digital Housekeeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDBMyNBUWKA&list=PL_JVnPgp2IReOqONl_74q9XF1nMoRuv8A&index=8), at the end of July I decided to challenge myself and clean my email inbox in one sitting.

## Problems

I had two major problems caused by a poorly managed email system:
- I was missing important incoming messages;
- The sheer volume of inbox messages was visually distracting.

## Planning Stage

I had to plan a long session of uninterrupted work to be able to do this in one sitting. This was important to me: I was about to begin another stage of my independent studies and I needed the least amount of friction possible, to avoid being distracted or hindered in my efforts.

It took me about five hours of focused work, without distractions or external interruptions. I had a few breaks to recharge both focus and motivation to complete this task.

## The system

Here's how I did it:

### Unsubscribing from everything that didn't serve my current goals

This is was crucial step, as it limited the inflow of unwanted messages. I used the search function for this, unsubscribing and immediately deleting all the messages from that sender. 

It was a slow, but very important process.

### Creating folders to store processed messages

I created folders as I sorted the messages. Here are some examples:
- Personal;
- Learning:
- Family;
- Finances;
	- Bank
- Orders;
	- Pending orders;
- Reading;
- Receipts;
	- Shopping;
	- Utilities;
- Work.

### Processing messages

Using the search function, I deleted every message that I evaluated as not important. The important ones were moved into their respective folders.

Nowadays, when I receive a message, I do my best to immediately process it : Do I need to save it? If so, I move it to its folder, creating one if necessary. If it's not important, I delete it.

I clear the trash folder right away. By doing this, I make sure that I'm mindful about the evaluation process.

I don't use the arquive option. Every message has its proper place: it either goes into a folder or it is deleted.

### Result

As the message count went down, a feeling of hope and relief kept growing. But it took time and patience. And then, it was **zero**. 

The challenge had been overcome. After all, it is possible to clear a poorly managed email inbox.

## Conclusion

When the inbox is empty, I get constant motivation to use this systematic approach and keep it empty. If there are 15 or 20 messages, I can easily sort them and delete the ones that I don't need to save. 

One month after the initial cleanup, I restructured the folders to adapt to my needs.

As this is an evolving system, I'll change it whenever it's necessary.

This was a meaningful experience, since I had to evaluate my goals and change how I use this tool. Now it works for me, not the other way around.
