# Climbing Mountains Into the Cloud

Welcome to my website. I'm Monica, a DevOps Enthusiast currently working as an OR Nurse in the Lisbon District.

Here I'll share about the technical topics I'm learning and experimenting with such as Linux, Scripting, Containers, Container Orchestration and Cloud Platforms.

Since I am very interested in productivity and efficiency, you will also find posts about note taking, learning and focused work.
