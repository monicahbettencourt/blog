My name is Monica Horta Bettencourt, a DevOps Enthusiast currently working as an OR Nurse in the Lisbon District.

I've been surrounded by technology since childhood, thanks to my relatives' interests and occupations. While working in healthcare, I've been able to follow the development of information technology systems in the field, remaining curious and eager to learn how to make the most out of them.

For quite a while, I'd been searching for something new and practical to learn, experiment with, write about, and share with anyone interested in it. 
And then a Raspberry Pi entered the scene. I found that these small devices were transmitting live data from medical equipment to a software application.

My interest piqued, and I became very curious about software integration and APIs as a solution to many healthcare applications that currently don't communicate with each other.
This led me to a broad beginner programming course for non-IT professionals at a national university exchange. Here, I expanded my horizons and was introduced to the software development life cycle, including deployment and automation. Then and there, I knew that I had found what I'd been looking for so long.

After experimenting with Hardware and Operating Systems' installations, I'm currently focused on learning Linux to a deep level, to build a solid foundation for Containers and Cloud Technologies.

As I revel in solving problems and streamlining processes, this is the perfect field to put that into action: I'm able to learn by experimenting and building in my home lab, troubleshooting issues, and breaking things to then rebuild in a better way. 

# About This Website

Building this website with the Hugo framework was my first real project. It was both challenging and rewarding, since I had never worked on something like this before.

In here, I'll share what I'm learning about and the processes involved.
